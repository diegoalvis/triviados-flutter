## Getting Started

The purpouse of this project is to have a practical example of the [Clean Arquitecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and some patterns like [BLoC](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4074597-getting-started-with-the-bloc-pattern).

This project was inspired by [ResoCoder Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course](https://resocoder.com/category/tutorials/flutter/tdd-clean-architecture/).
